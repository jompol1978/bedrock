        <div class="mzp-c-call-out-desc">
          <p>Open a new tab in Firefox, go to your Facebook page and enjoy as usual. The difference is that your session is contained. When you click to another site, it’s now harder for Facebook to follow you and collect your data. And without that data, Facebook has less information about you to offer ad makers, political and otherwise.</p>

      <div class="mzp-c-call-out-desc">
        <p>Log into Facebook and the ProPublica extension automatically collects the ads targeting your newsfeed. Click on the ProPublica icon in the Firefox toolbar to view those ads and compare them with ads other Facebook users are seeing. Want to learn more? This database sorts political ads based on who they were targeting.</p>
